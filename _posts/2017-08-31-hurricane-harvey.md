Luckily, Rice's campus held up really well through the storm. We never lost water or electricity, we had no shortage of food, and the damage was generally limited to some trees falling. Things could have definitely been much worse, so we got off pretty easily.

The extra time has made adjusting to college life a little easier, as there's been nothing but socializing since the weekend. On the other hand, academics for the rest of the semester will definitely be a bit of a shock, since a week of classes can only be made up for in a really fast and compact curriculum.

As I'm trying to balance my work and find time for everything, this will likely make things more difficult. College *is* supposed to challenge you, though, so I'm trying to anticipate those challenges and get out ahead of them.
